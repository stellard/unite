gem install unite

gem 'unite'


Based on 

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/units95.html


Handles the following dimensions 

 [:length, :time, :temperature, :mass, :current, :substance, :luminosity, :money]

 Can use Unite::Quantity to represent values or include the functionality into your own objects.
 
 Look at https://github.com/stellard/unite/blob/master/lib/unite/quantity.rb for a minum implementation
 
 Examples: (needs more info here)
 
 Unite::Quantity.init("1000*km")
 Unite::Quantity.init("1000","km")

 Unit definitions are found here
 
 https://github.com/stellard/unite/blob/master/lib/unite/lookup/definitions.rb
 
 Specs show good examples of use. 
 
 I will add more to readme
